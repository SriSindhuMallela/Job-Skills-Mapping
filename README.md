# Job-and-Skills-Mapping-Dashboard

The project aims to create a user-friendly dashboard that maps various occupations in various industries across different demographic regions. The dashboard will help job seekers make informed career choices by evaluating data from O*NET and BLS OEWS resources. The visualizations will show the skills, technologies, and employment statistics required for various occupations, enabling users to consider potential career routes and training opportunities. This project seeks to narrow the gap between job seekers and employers by providing a platform to learn the necessary skills for success.

## Data

O*NET and OWES Data

## Analysis

In the data preprocessing stage, we employed multiple tools like SQL, Excel, and Python to clean and filter the data. We ensured that the data was structured appropriately before moving on to conducting an in-depth analysis to derive meaningful insights. The analytical techniques we utilized included temporal, geospatial, topical, network, and relational analysis. The temporal analysis helped us identify trends in the data over time. The geospatial analysis helped us find trends and patterns in different regions and locations. The topical analysis allowed us to identify the topics that emerged from the data, while network analysis helped us examine relationships and connections between various occupations and skills. Additionally, relational analysis enabled us to understand the relationships between different variables and how they interacted with each other.
To present the insights effectively, I used visualization tools such as Tableau, PowerBI, and Gephi. We created interactive and engaging visualizations that will help stakeholders understand the insights and trends better. My approach ensured that the data was thoroughly analyzed, and valuable insights were extracted and presented in an easily understandable format.
